The company's implied senior debt rating is B-minus.     S and P said the downgrade reflected expectations of restricted financial flexibility through at least the intermediate term. It also cited a highly leveraged balance sheet and reduced access to capital.     The rating agency said International Rectifier's ability to reduce high debt levels and interest expense through cash from operations is very limited. </field></doc></add>
