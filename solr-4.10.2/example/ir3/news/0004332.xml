The agency said its review would focus on the implications of Dana's aggressive balance sheet management on liquidity and financial flexibility. Moody's will also take into account intensifying competition and pricing difficulties in Dana's highly cyclical core truck and industrial markets.     Dana currently carries A-2 senior debt and industrial revenue bonds. The Prime-1 commercial paper of Dana and its credit unit are also under review for possible downgrade. </field></doc></add>
