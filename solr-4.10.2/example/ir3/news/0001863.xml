Next years APC, held in Atlanta, will be a business session only and will continue to be the first week of March.     The trade show is being changed into a new international event called the World Pork Expo. The first expo will be held in June 1988 in Des Moines with an expanded format, they said.     Executive vice-president Orville Sweet said the decision to spilt the show and Congress came about because there are producers who never get to see the trade show floor.     "It makes sense that we divide the business session from the trade show," Sweet said. </field></doc></add>
