President Kjell Nilsson, announcing the 600 mln crown deal, told a news conference Boliden would now become a truly international concern with operations in Brazil, Chile and other big minerals-producing nations.     He said the Allis-Chalmers' division, accounting for some 50 pct of the U.S. Group's sales, would fit in well into Boliden. </field></doc></add>
