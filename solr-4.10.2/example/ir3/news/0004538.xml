Parliament also granted an 800 mln crown cash infusion to ease cash flow problems that arose when the bank lost 600 mln crowns in a shipping firm bankruptcy two years ago.     Utvegsbanki director Halldor Gudbjarnarson told Reuters the decision to privatise the bank was a relief and that foreign banks had already expressed interest in taking a share.     A quarter of the one billion crown total share capital will be available to foreign investors, government officials said. </field></doc></add>
