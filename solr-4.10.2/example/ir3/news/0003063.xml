Asked in an interview if it was time to consider a marketing loan for soybeans, Lyng said, "I don't think so. I don't think the world price is lower than our price anyway."     However, the USDA secretary said that if current conditions of surplus production persisted, it might be appropriate to consider a marketing loan.     "I suppose that under that condition there is a danger our exports will continue to drop and that the government will continue to accumulate large stocks of soybeans," he said. "It might be (worth contemplating a marketing loan), if there were a world market that was lower than our market." </field></doc></add>
