Finnair chief Gunnar Korhonen would not discuss the price further than telling reporters the planes were "inexpensive," though market sources said the airline could expect a price cut as an earlier customer.    Korhonen said Finnair had not opted for Europe's A-340 plane because of uncertainty about the manufacturing of its engines, which may have delayed production of the jet. </field></doc></add>
