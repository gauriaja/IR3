"I have too much work to accomplish here in Brazil at the moment. Besides the presence of the IBC president at an ICO executive board meeting is not a tradition," Dauster said.     Dauster said except in rare cases, Brazil has always sent its London-based representative to ICO board meetings. Ambassador Lindenberg Sette will attend the meeting, he said. </field></doc></add>
