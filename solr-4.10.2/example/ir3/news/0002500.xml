"The patent strengthens Genzyme's proprietary position as the leading independent supplier of diagnostic enzymes and substrates," Henri Temeer, Genzyme president, said.     The company said the technology combines a unique substrate with two indicator enzymes in a diagnostic assay to measure serum amylase levels.     Genzyme said that since 1985 it has entered into several licensing agreements for the technology with amylase test kit makers. </field></doc></add>
