"The data we have in hand do not provide clearcut evidence that the deterioration in the trade balance has yet been reversed," Volcker said in remarks prepared for delivery to a luncheon for community leaders here.     However, Volcker said there are encouraging signs, particularly the rising volume of exports over the past year, achieved despite relatively slow growth abroad.     Volcker warned it is not sustainable from an economic perspective to pile up foreign debt while failing to make the investment needed to generate growth and earn the money to service the debt.     He said the process of restoring external balance to the U.S. economy requires dealing with the budget deficit. He said needed economic adjustment will require a relative shift of financial and real resources into internationally competitive industry. "More of our growth will need to be reflected in net exports and business investment and less in consumption," Volcker said. </field></doc></add>
