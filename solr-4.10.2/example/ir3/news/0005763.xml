PORTS REOPEN, BUT FURTHER DISRUPTION LIKELY</field><field name="place">WELLINGTON</field><field name="date">March 23</field><field name="content">- New Zealand ports reopened at 0730 hrs local time (1930 GMT March 22) after being closed since March 19 because of a strike over pay claims by watersiders, a Waterside Federation spokesman said.     But industrial action by other port workers is likely to cause further disruption, Harbour Workers union secretary Ross Wilson told Reuters.     Wilson said his members are holding stopwork meetings this morning to consider further stoppages over their pay claim.     The two disputes are not related.     Harbour Workers around the country went on strike for 24 hours on March 16, but Wilson said any further action will occur on a port-by-port basis. </field></doc></add>
