An exchange spokeswoman said the change will allow oil traders that do not hold a futures position to initiate, after the exchange closes, a transaction that can subsequently be hedged in the futures market.     EFPs, already in effect for platinum futures on NYMEX, are expected to increase the open interest and liquidity in U.S. energy futures, according to traders and analysts.     The Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved the rule change in February, according to a CFTC spokeswoman. </field></doc></add>
