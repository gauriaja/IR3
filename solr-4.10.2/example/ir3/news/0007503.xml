He told reporters the deposits, located at four sites near the town of San Ignasio, contained the equivalent of 100 tonnes of gold.     Garcia said the government would soon install a two mln dlr treatment plant at Tomaque. It will extract enough ore to provide an estimated 25 mln dlr profit by the end of this year, he added.     Garcia said the other gold-bearing deposits are located at Tamborapa, Pachapidiana and a zone between the Cenepa and Santiago rivers. </field></doc></add>
