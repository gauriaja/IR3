It said the debt was part of a 33.90 billion franc liability incurred through the activation of EMCF swap facilities to defend the franc before the January 11 European Monetary System realignment.     The realignment, following several weeks of speculative pressure, produced a three pct revaluation of the West German mark and the Dutch guilder against the French franc and a two pct revaluation of the Belgian franc. </field></doc></add>
