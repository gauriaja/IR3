"We are not sure how much (Soviets have bought) but we think it could be as high as 3.5 mln tonnes," Amstutz told a House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee.     He added that China also will need to import more corn this year than earlier anticipated, but he gave no figures. </field></doc></add>
