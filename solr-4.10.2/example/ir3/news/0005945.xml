The agency cited Ecolab's definitive agreement to acquire ChemLawn for 370 mln dlrs.     "The acquisition should be financed initially with bank debt that, together with the assumption of ChemLawn's debt, could raise significantly Ecolab's leverage.     Under review are Ecolab's A-3 convertible subordinated debentures and the convertible Eurodebt of its unit, E.L. International Ltd. ChemLawn has B-1 convertible debt. </field></doc></add>
