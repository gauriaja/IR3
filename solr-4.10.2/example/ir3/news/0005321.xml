The spokesman declined to say exactly how large the losses were. Berliner Bank has suspended the three managers of its Stuttgart branch and is continuing an investigation into the case, in which state prosecutors are also participating.     The fact that powers had been exceeded emerged in a routine check at the branch. The City of West Berlin owns 74 pct of Berliner Bank and the rest is held by small shareholders. </field></doc></add>
