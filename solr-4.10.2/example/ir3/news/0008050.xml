"In my judgement, we're not even close to a trade war," Yeutter told a House Agriculture Committee hearing.     Yeutter said if Japan takes action to honor its agreement with the U.S. on semiconductor trade, "Then the retaliatory response will last a relatively short period."     Yeutter said Japan must stop dumping chips in third countries and buy more American computer chips. </field></doc></add>
