[South Central Bell Telephone Co], a unit of Bellsouth Corp [BLS.N], placed the order with Plessey's U.S. Subsidiary [Stromberg-Carlson].     Most of the equipment for the 100 exchanges will be built in Stromberg-Carlson's Florida plant over the next three years.     "It is the most important thing that has happened in the Plessey telecommunications business," said Plessey Telecommunications Managing Director David Dey.     The British firm failed to win a four billion dlr deal to supply an advanced communications system to the U.S. Army in November 1985 despite personal lobbying by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. A rival French system won the contract. </field></doc></add>
