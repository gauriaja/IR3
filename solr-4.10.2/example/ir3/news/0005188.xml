Lawson said in a television interview that he did not regard the pound's present exchange rate was uncomfortably high.     "I think it is round about right," he said.     "I think there was a time that they (British manufacturers) thought the (exchange) rate was uncomfortably high. But I think they are very satisfied with the present level."     "But I have made it absolutely clear that I don't want to see the pound go through the roof," he added. </field></doc></add>
