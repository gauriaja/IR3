The acquisition was contingent on its ability to obtain financing to fund the 1.9 mln dlr cash portion of the purchase price, InterCare said.     It also said the offering was aimed at raising 7.5 mln dlrs for working capital and 1.7 mln to repay debt incurred in connection with its recent acquisition of U.S. Medical Enterprises Inc.     The company further stated that it has a 1.7 mln dlr working capital deficit and it will therefore reduce operating expenses by decreasing operating hours, workforce reductions and the sale of certain assets. </field></doc></add>
