S and P cited the firm's tender offer to acquire Conrac Corp [CAX] for 152.5 mln dlrs. Conrac has no rated debt.     Although Mark IV has an overall favorable business standing, the acquisition would impair earnings and cash flow protection, S and P said.     S and P pointed out that debt leverage would rise to about 90 pct, assuming total debt financing. It said it will review the company's management strategy and financial plans.
