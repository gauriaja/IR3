He said the court move aimed to freeze Saunders' assets up to the value of the sum it wanted to recover. It was uncertain whether the court would reach any decision on the request today. Guinness said last week it planned to take legal action to recover the funds, paid to non-executive director Thomas Ward via the Jersey company.     Lawyers representing Ward have said he saw the funds as his reward for services performed during the takeover of Distillers.     Guinness is also planning a resolution at the annual meeting in May to remove both Saunders and Ward from the company's board. </field></doc></add>
