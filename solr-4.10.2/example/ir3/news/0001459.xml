Industries Inc said it expects a loss of about two mln dlrs in its third quarter ended February 28 from the proposed sale of its Omnilab Inc health care unit.     S.A.Y said its board of directors approved the unit's sale because Omnilab was losing about 140,000 dlrs a quarter.     "We no longer see a near-term prospect for a reasonable return on our investment," Romilly Humphries, S.A.Y. president and chief executive officer said.     S.A.Y. said proceeds from the sale would be used to increase the company's market share in automotive products packaging and diversify its packaging capabilities. </field></doc></add>
