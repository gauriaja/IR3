They said the below-six pct Federal funds rate suggests the Fed does not have a large reserve adding need. However, some dealers reportedly backed out of the three-day System repurchase agreements set on Monday, leaving the Fed with a somewhat increased need to supply reserves.     Federal funds, which averaged 6.05 pct yesterday, opened at 5-15/16 pct and remained there in early trading. </field></doc></add>
