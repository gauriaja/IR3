They said Chirac promised that France's decision would be based on financial, economic and technical criteria, and not on political grounds.     U.S. and German companies are the leading contenders to take control of CGCT.     The Reagan administration has warned France and Germany that it may retaliate if control of the company is awarded on political grounds.     Jacques Delors, President of the European Community's Executive Commission, called last month for control to go to West Germany's Siemens AG in order to strengthen European industry.     The other leading contender is a consortium of American Telephone and Telegraph Co [T] with Philips NV of the Netherlands.     Chirac said France would make public its reasons for awarding control, the sources said. He was asked about the company's fate on two occasions, in meetings with leaders of the Senate and House of Representatives. </field></doc></add>
