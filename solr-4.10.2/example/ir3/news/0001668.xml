The amount will be set at tender on Monday March 9 between 0800 and 0830 GMT. The new facility will replace the current 4.8 billion guilders of seven-day advances expiring Monday.     Money dealers estimated today's money market shortage at 11 to 11.25 billion guilders, barely changed from yesterday.     They said call money was still relatively high at 6-1/8 to 6-1/4 pct as a result of the tight set of bids accepted by the Bank for the previous seven-day facility. </field></doc></add>
