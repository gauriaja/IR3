In response to hostile questioning from a member of the House Appropriations Committee, the officials said the plan was justified to help bring the fiscal 1988 budget deficit and to get the government out of the oil business.     Miller acknowleged the estimated sale proceeds at 3.3 billion dlrs would actually bring down the deficit by about 2.2 billion dlrs because of the loss of revenues from the sale of oil from the reserves.     Miller said the sale price may end up higher.     "We'd sell it to the highest bidder," Miller said.     "If we can get more we'll take it." </field></doc></add>
