The source, who declined to be identified, said Iran had fired the Chinese-made missile at a hulk off its southern Gulf naval port of Bandar Abbas and scored a hit.     "These missiles pack a fairly big punch," he told Reuters. "There is no doubt they could be used to target (shipping) across the Strait of Hormuz." </field></doc></add>
