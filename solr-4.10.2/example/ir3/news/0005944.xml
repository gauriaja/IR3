One minister was dropped in the shuffle, announced in a presidential decree. It gave no reason for the changes in the government of the Arab Baath Socialist Party which has ruled Iraq since a revolution in 1968.     The decree named the head of the Iraqi National Oil Company (INOC), Isam Abdul-Rahim al-Chalaby, to take over as oil minister replacing Qassem Ahmed Taqi.     Taqi, appointed oil minister in the last significant government reorganization in 1982, was moved to be minister of heavy industries. </field></doc></add>
