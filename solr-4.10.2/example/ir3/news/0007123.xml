McGraw Hill fell 2-1/4 to 68-1/4 on 223,000 shares.     Atorino said his decision reflected mainly non-operating factors and a recent gain in the share price. He said after several acquisitions last year good will charges are up. Also, the company faces a higher tax rate.     Atorino expects earnings of 3.55 dlrs per share this year, up from 3.04 dlrs last year. </field></doc></add>
