He said Thailand will pay for 25 pct of the cost of the cranes in U.S. Dlrs and the rest by sales of rice, textiles and other commodities to Yugoslavia.     The Bangkok Shipowners and Agents Association has appealed to the government to scrap the purchase plan. It said it would be an unnecessary expense as most vessels calling at the port already have their own cargo handling equipment. </field></doc></add>
