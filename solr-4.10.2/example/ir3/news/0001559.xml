Moody's said it would assess the likely financial consequences of the 19 mln dlr rate reduction ordered today by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission.     The unexpected order raises significant doubts about the quality of Duquesne's regulatory support and financial prospects. The Commission's determination that Perry Unit 1's power is not needed could depress Duquesne's earnings and cash flow well into the future. Duqusne has Baa-1 senior debt and preferred stock and Baa-2 debentures and preference stock. </field></doc></add>
