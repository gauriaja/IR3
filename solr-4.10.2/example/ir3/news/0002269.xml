The case will be heard again on May 4, when a summary judgement will decide if the civil case should proceed.     Khoo owned most of the bank's equity before it was closed in November by the Brunei government after some of its officials were charged with mismanagement.     The bank, now controlled by Brunei, is seeking repayment of about 900 mln Singapore dlrs in loans guaranteed by Khoo. </field></doc></add>
