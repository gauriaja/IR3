Dlrs in 1986 from 8.59 billion dlrs in 1985, Hong Kong's Census and Statistics Department said.     Taiwan's exports to China through Hong Kong fell to 6.33 billion dlrs last year from 7.69 billion in 1985, while China's exports rose to 1.12 billion dlrs from 904 mln dlrs.     Economists in Hong Kong told Reuters that China's controls on scarce foreign currency hurt its imports of Taiwanese consumer goods, such as electric fans and television sets.     Herbal medicine and textiles were among China's chief exports to Taiwan.     Taiwan does not allow direct trade with China and indirect trade is routed mainly through Hong Kong. </field></doc></add>
