It said it planned to invite shareholders and non-voting stockholders to subscribe to a warrant bond issue of around 150 mln Swiss francs to be made after the June 2 annual meeting.     The value of the stock subscription rights should correspond roughly to the dividend of 30 francs per share paid in 1984. The company also plans to issue participation certificates with a par value of 70 mln Swiss francs, from which existing shareholders are excluded. </field></doc></add>
