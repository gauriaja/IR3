The debentures have an 8-5/8 pct coupon and were priced at 98.675 to yield 115 basis points over the off-the-run 9-1/4 pct Treasury bonds of 2016.     Non-refundable for 10 years, the issue is rated A-1 by Moody's and A by Standard and Poor's. A sinking fund beginning in 1998 to retire annually five pct of the debentures can be increased by 200 pct at the company's option.     Dillon, Read and Co Inc co-managed the deal. </field></doc></add>
