Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President Reagan had no position on recommendations submitted by Energy Secretary John Herrington to encourage investment in the hard hit domestic oil industry.     But Fitzwater noted that Reagan did have a fundamental objection to tax rises and special tax breaks.     He said that even though Herrington's recommendation did not agree with existing policy, "We'll take a look at it."     The review will be undertaken by the president's Domestic Policy Council.     Herrington's proposal was reported by the Washington Post to have been made in a letter to Reagan submitting a study that found the United States would be importing half of its oil by the 1990s, threatening U.S. national security. </field></doc></add>
