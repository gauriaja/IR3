The Dutch news agency said SURALCO, a subsidiary of the Aluminum Company of America(ALCOA) wanted to reduce its work force because it had been hard hit by guerrilla attacks that cut power lines to the area in January.     All bauxite mining at Moengo ceased four months ago and SURALCO's Paranam alumina smelter is using imported bauxite. </field></doc></add>
