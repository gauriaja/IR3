The new CDs have maturities of six months, one year and two years and bear interest rates ranging from 4.07 pct to 5.12 pct, he said.     The issues are aimed at helping curb the growth of M-1b money supply, which is the result of large foreign exchange reserves. The reserves now total more than 51 billion U.S. Dlrs. </field></doc></add>
