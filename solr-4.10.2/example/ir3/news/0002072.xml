"We believe our members' interests can be well served within the Chrysler family, and we are committed to making that happen," UAW president Owen Bieber and vice president Marc Stepp said in a statement.     "We believe Chrysler's purchase is a logical and sound step for all concerned," the union said.     The UAW is negotiating with AMC over the carmaker's demand for economic concessions covering workers at its Wisconsin operations, without which AMC has said it would cease vehicle production at its Kenosha, Wisconsin, assembly plant by 1989. </field></doc></add>
