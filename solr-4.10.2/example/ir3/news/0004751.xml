The Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Commerce approved as an amendment to the overall House trade bill a provision giving Reagan the power to block sales to foreign companies if the sale was not in the national or economic interest.     The subcommittee rejected a proposal requiring the U.S. to pay investors one pct for the right to hold their gold investments in government storage. His amendment called for the government to sell gold coins and gold-backed bonds with maturities of 30 to 50 years to investors to reduce the federal debt. </field></doc></add>
