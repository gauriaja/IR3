Moody's said the review was prompted by the recent bid by investor Martin Sosnoff to acquire control of the company. While Sosnoff's bid depends on several factors, including licensing by both the Nevada and New Jersey gaming commissions, the deal could result in a significant increase in Caesars World's leverage, the rating agency said.     Caesars currently carries B-1 convertible debt and the finance has same-rated subordinated debentures. </field></doc></add>
