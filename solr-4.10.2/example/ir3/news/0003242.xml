The bank estimated today's liquidity shortage at about 1.10 billion stg.     Bills maturing in official hands and the treasury bill take-up would drain 1.21 billion stg from the system while a rise in the note circulation and below target bankers' balances would take out 265 mln and 180 mln respectively, the bank said.     Against this, exchequer transactions would add a net 535 mln stg. </field></doc></add>
