The calls, to be made effective June 30 and September 30, affected respectively the 7-1/4 pct bond of 1975 for 250 mln francs and the 6-1/2 pct bond of the same year for 300 mln.     A spokesman said the ministry had not yet decided whether to convert the issues into new bonds, but it had outlined plans for two new bonds, each of 250 mln francs. The strong state of government finances might permit it not to issue one or both of them, he said. </field></doc></add>
