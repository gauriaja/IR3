The new CDs, with maturities of six months, one year and two years, carry interest rates ranging from 4.07 pct to 5.12 pct, a bank official told Reuters.     The issues are designed to help curb the growth of m-1b money supply, which is expanding as a result of large foreign exchange reserves.     The reserves hit a record 53 billion U.S. Dlrs yesterday. </field></doc></add>
