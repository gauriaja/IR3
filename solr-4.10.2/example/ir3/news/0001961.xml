National Westminster said that it was responding to general easing in money market rates.     Its move followed a signal from the Bank of England earlier this afternoon that it would endorse a half point cut in the base rate, a surprise move following its strong signals last week that such a move would be premature.     However, since then the pound has continued to gain strongly. </field></doc></add>
