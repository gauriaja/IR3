It said any rating change until then would depend on each individual bank holding company. S and P noted that the combined entity would have assets of more than 24 billion dlrs, making it one of the largest U.S. bankholding companies.     Fleet has A-plus senior debt, A subordinated debt and A-1 commercial paper. Norstar carries AA senior debt, AA-minus subordinated debt, A-plus preferred stock and A-1-plus paper. </field></doc></add>
