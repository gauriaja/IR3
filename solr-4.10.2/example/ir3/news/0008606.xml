Talks have focused on administrative matters and verification of stocks in producer countries, they said.     Producers met briefly today to exchange views on the market situation but there seems little chance discussion on quotas will begin much before the ICO's annual council session in September, they said.     Delegates earlier thought the meeting would end tonight, but a further session is scheduled tomorrow at 1030 GMT to complete reports on stock verification.     Meantime, the executive board will meet May 12 to discuss possible action on the consultancy report on the ICO presented today to the board, consumer delegates said. </field></doc></add>
