The agreement by the seven-member Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) aimed to cut the world surplus and boost prices. Following the accord, ATPC Chairman Subroto appealed to the United States to restrict its tin releases from its strategic stockpile.     "We don't think that (the U.S. government) has a large influence in the (tin) market at this stage of the game," said Thomas O'Donnell, Director of International Commodities at the State Department. Last year the United States released about 4,900 tonnes of tin to two ferroalloy firms. </field></doc></add>
