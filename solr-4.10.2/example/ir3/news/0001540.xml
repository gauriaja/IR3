Speaking to reporters after a shareholders meeting, he said Eurotunnel would offer "a menu of securities" designed to overcome investor reluctance.     Details are still to be worked out but investors could be offered a choice of paying immediately for shares or buying them on a part-paid basis, or buying convertible bonds, or bonds with warrants giving a right to buy shares at a later date, he said. </field></doc></add>
