The average trade guess for 1987 planted corn acreage was 66.06 mln acres, ranging from 60.7 to 69.0 mln, all well below the 76.67 mln planted last year due to improved incentives by the USDA for farmers to retire acres. Corn acres totalled only 60.22 mln in 1983, when the PIK program was introduced.     The average soybean planted acreage quesstimate was 59.49 mln, ranging from 58.0 to 63.0 mln and compared with the 61.48 mln planted in 1986     With substantial grain stocks, less interest was expressed among analysts in the USDA stocks report also scheduled today. </field></doc></add>
