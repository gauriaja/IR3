The expected shortage and stronger demand for rubber goods, especially condoms and surgical gloves by consumers, is likely to push up prices, the Malaysian Rubber Exchange and Licensing Board said in its latest monthly bulletin.     During the annual wintering period from February to April rubber trees shed their leaves and latex output is very low. </field></doc></add>
