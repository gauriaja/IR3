They said maritime unions imposed bans on late Wednesday for reasons that are obscure but seem to be linked with claims for a pay rise above the 10 dlrs a week awarded by the Arbitration Commission nationally to all workers recently.     Only about 10 vessels are being delayed but the bans will affect container terminal movements and will disrupt liner schedules, they said.     The dispute goes to the Commission on Monday, they said. </field></doc></add>
