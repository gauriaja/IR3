AFBF president Dean Kleckner made the comments in response to the ruling earlier today by the Canadian Import Tribunal that subsidized U.S. corn imports were injurious to Canadian growers. The tribunal upheld a countervailing duty of 84.9 U.S. cents a bushel.     "Farm Bureau specialists went to Ottawa and testified previous U.S. farm programs have actually benefited all foreign producers by reducing the amount of corn grown in the U.S. (and losing market share), while exerting an upward influence on the price of corn Worldwide," he said. </field></doc></add>
