Taking advantage of scarcity, private roasters were selling ground coffee mixtures which were 75 pct non-coffee, it said. Since the beginning of March, the coffee market has been strictly regulated by the state food marketing monopoly Enapal.     Now a third of imported coffee will be sold as pure beans and two thirds as a ground mixture with a choice of 30 pct chickpeas or 30 pct barley. In March private dealers will handle 2,050 tonnes of pure coffee and Enapal 6,050 tonnes of mixtures. </field></doc></add>
