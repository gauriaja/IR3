The Federal Communications Commission approved the sale last December, GenCorp said. The closing was delayed because that decision was appealed by four parties to the U.S. Court of Appeals, GenCorp explained.     WOR-TV is based in  Secaucus, N.J., GenCorp said.     Earlier today, [General Partners] said it was prepared to raise its bid to 110 dlrs per share, or even more, in its bid for GenCorp. </field></doc></add>
