Carling said it will record an extraordinary gain of about two mln dlrs after tax, or nine cts a common share resulting from the sale.     The company did not elaborate further on financial terms.     A Carling official later said in reply to an inquiry that Carling would record the extraordinary gain in its fourth quarter ending March 31.     The move came after Carling's 50 pct-owner [Rothmans Inc] agreed last week to sell its Carling stake to [Elders IXL Ltd], of Australia, for 196.2 mln Canadian dlrs. </field></doc></add>
