It said the increase was exclusively due to higher beet sugar content, which went up to 17.93 pct from 17.3 pct in 1985.     Last year's beet deliveries totalled 20.22 mln tonnes, down 554,000 tonnes from the previous year.     The ministry estimates West Germany's sugar self-sufficiency during the current agricultural year (July/June) unchanged at 137 pct. </field></doc></add>
