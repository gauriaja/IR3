"The 19 pct reserve requirement will only be applied to further increases in bank's convertible peseta funds," the spokesman said. Convertible peseta funds previously were exempt from reserve requirements. The spokesman said the measure was intended to curb an influx of short-term foreign speculative capital which threatened the government's money supply growth target. </field></doc></add>
