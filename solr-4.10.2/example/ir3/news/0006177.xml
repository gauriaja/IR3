The offering consists of 50 mln dlrs of 12 pct senior subordinated notes due 1997 and 50,000 contingent payment obligations. The notes are priced at par, or 1,000 dlrs each.     A unit has one par value note and one contingent payment obligation. The notes are redeemable by Van Dusen after March 15, 1992, Salomon said.     A payment obligation entitles the holder to receive a cash payment under certain events, or to certain repurchase rights. </field></doc></add>
