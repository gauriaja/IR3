Bids amounted to 19,115 tonnes against offerings of 31,528. Prices paid were at, or above, the prevailing intervention feed wheat price of 120.71 stg per tonne.     Grain traders said a large part of the tonnage on offer was in stores, which would mean high transport costs to deficient areas. The European Commission recently made available 70,000 tonnes for next week's tender. </field></doc></add>
