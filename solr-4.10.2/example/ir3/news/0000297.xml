Deputy Secretary Peter Myers said the action was being taken to help alleviate the short supply of oats.     Under limited cross compliance, the plantings of other program crops on the farm may not exceed the crop acreage bases of those crops.     The lifting of the cross-compliance on oats permits the planting of oats in excess of the oat acreage base without sacrificing eligibility for other crop program benefits.     Myers said soybean plantings are expected to decrease as a result of the action on oats, planting of which are expected to increase by two to three mln acres.  </field></doc></add>
