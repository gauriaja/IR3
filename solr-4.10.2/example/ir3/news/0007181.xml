Meyers Co Group to 11 pct from 9.7 pct.     He also said an investment banker repesenting him met with Myers' officers, telling them of his plans for a takeover and that he may solicit proxies for a seat on Myers' board.     Chavin also said if he takes control of the firm, it could result in delisting Meyers' from the New York Stock Exchange.     He told the SEC that while he is trying to buy or acquire the firm, he still may only hold the shares for an investment. </field></doc></add>
