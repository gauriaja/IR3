He told Parliament that in the southern provinces the harvest would be over 50 pct down on the level in the previous marketing year.     "The nation would be lucky to produce over seven mln bags (630,000 tonnes) of maize this year," he stated.     Chinkuli added that Zambia was setting up an irrigation fund with Canadian aid to lessen the effects of poor rainfall. </field></doc></add>
