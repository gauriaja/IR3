Claiborne Pell introduced legislation to permit eight states along the northeast corridor to sell tax-exempt transportation bonds to improve high speed rail service.     His legislation, which also rejects President Reagan's call to sell the Amtrak rail line, would affect the states of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland.     His plan is an outgrowth of a study by a coalition of northeast governors. </field></doc></add>
