Stanley said, however, that any reduction in first quarter operating income will be offset by reduced interest expense and that first quarter net income will be about flat with first quarter 1986 net income of 14 cts a share, or 286,000 dlrs.     Stanely also said the first quarter's sales losses would be made up by shipments in the second quarter. </field></doc></add>
