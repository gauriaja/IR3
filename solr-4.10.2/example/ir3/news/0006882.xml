He told business executives the most important issues for the world economy are the correction of international trade imbalances and a solution to the world debt problem.     To this end, Japan and the U.S. Must make medium- and long-term efforts to alter economic structures which have expanded the trade gap between the two nations. World economic growth and therefore an expansion of debtor countries' export markets are needed to solve the debt issue, he added. </field></doc></add>
