If the charges are true "we are disappointed and angry," Merrill Lynch said in a statement. Merrill Lynch said it has been cooperating with a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of the matter for several months. The SEC charged Nahum Vaskevitch, a managing director of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Ltd, with profiting from inside information about 12 companies involved in mergers.     "Merrill Lynch's position is and has always been that violations of the law are not tolerated," the firm said in a prepared statement.     "The apparently illegal trading activity took place away from Merrill Lynch through another broker-dealer and involved the employee's use of information which was properly available to him but improperly used," the statement said. "Merrill Lynch in no way benefited from the trades."     Merrill Lynch said Vaskevitch was suspended "when we were informed of the specific allegations and evidence." The company did not say precisely when the suspension took place. </field></doc></add>
