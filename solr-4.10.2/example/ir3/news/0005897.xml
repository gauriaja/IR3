Timber Realization, a limited partnership formed to dispose of timberlands and related properties transferred to it by the [Masonite Corp], said that when this sale is completed the partnership will have received about 15.2 mln dlrs in cash and notes from the sale of its properties since December 23, 1986.     The partnership said it will terminate before August 3, 1987.     Prior to that date, the partnership said it expects to form a liquidating trust to provide for unresolved claims and liablities.     Timber Realization said the amount retained in that trust will depend on its experience in resolving open items up to the termination date, but it added it expects to retain a substantial amount in the trust.     The partnership said it anticipates making a cash distribution of an as yet undetermined amount to unitholders at or before the liquidation trust's funding date.     </field></doc></add>
