Cut were the company's senior debt to BB-minus from BB and subordinated debt to B-plus from BB-minus. The implied senior secured debt rating is BB.     S and P said the action reflected Beverly's aggressive plans to repurchase stock that would increase financial risk while earnings prospects become more clouded.     Despite the planned use of proceeds from asset sales for a portion of the buy back's costs, decapitalization would raise adjusted debt leverage above the 75 pct level of recent years. </field></doc></add>
