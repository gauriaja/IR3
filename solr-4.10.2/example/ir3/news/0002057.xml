The reduction follows similar moves from the three other British clearing banks.     National Westminster Bank Plc led the way this morning after the Bank of England lowered its dealing rates in a signal that it would tolerate a half percentage point reduction.     The central bank's surprise signal followed its strenuous efforts last week to prevent market forces from bringing down base rates before the U.K. Budget on March 17. </field></doc></add>
