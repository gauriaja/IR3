They said the Fed does not have a much of an adding need this week and may wait until tomorrow or Monday before supplying reserves.     But a few economists said there was an outside chance that the Fed may inject reserves indirectly via a small round of customer repurchase agreements.     Federal funds hovered at 6-1/8 pct this morning after averaging 6.32 pct yesterday. </field></doc></add>
