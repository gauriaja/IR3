In late February, an investor group headed by Jacobs offered 44 dlrs a share, or 3.29 billion dlrs, to take over Borg-Warner.     Borg-Warner said it advised Jacobs that before its board would give Minstar access to company records Minstar would have to provide satisfactory evidence that sufficient financing was committed to carry out whatever transaction was proposed.     A Borg-Warner spokesperson said the discussions with Jacobs and other Minstar officials focused on terms and conditions under which the company would consider granting Minstar access to the information it was seeking.     The Borg-Warner spokesperson said the company has not been able to reach an agreement with Minstar, and Borg-Warner has not granted Minstar access to any records.     There can be no assurance that there will be further discussions with Jacobs or that any agreement will be reached, the company added. </field></doc></add>
