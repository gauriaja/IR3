Despite a dramatic rationalization of its fork-lift truck, axle and transmission, and construction equipment operations, continuing intense competitive pressures are limiting Clark's growth and profit potential, S and P said.     The company may be forced to increase debt to achieve its strategic acquisition goals, the rating agency added. </field></doc></add>
