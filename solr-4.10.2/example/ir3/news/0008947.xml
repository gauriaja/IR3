The deferral of all principal payments until April 1989 will save the company 12 mln dlrs in cash flow in each of the next two years, it said.     The restructured agreements call for suspending dividend payment on Tidewater's common and convertible adjustable preferred stock and contain other restrictive covenants, including a requirement to maintain minimum tangible net worth.     [Prudential Insurance Co] and Manufacturers Hanover Corp [MHC], the company's principle lenders, will receive as collateral a pledge of stock in Tidewater subsidiaries that own interests in oil and gas ventures offshore Indonesia.     Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, an Italian bank, will obtain a security interest in Tidewater's assets in Italy. </field></doc></add>
