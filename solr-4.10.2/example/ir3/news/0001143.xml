Testifying before the House Appropriations subcommittee which must approve his agency's 1988 budget, he said, "In my judgment economic factors justify a continued decline."     Asked by a committee member if he expected a further decline, and how much, Yeutter said the Taiwan and South Korean currencies should be adjusted to reflect "positive factors" in their economies. </field></doc></add>
