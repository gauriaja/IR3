The official said, "There has not been a consensus reached yet," when asked about reports the Paris club of western creditors had agreed to long-term stretch outs of African debt at concessional interest rates.     The official, briefing reporters on this week's semiannual IMF meetings, said the issue would be discussed this week and the U.S. had an open mind on the proposal but it did object to concessional interest rate relief. </field></doc></add>
