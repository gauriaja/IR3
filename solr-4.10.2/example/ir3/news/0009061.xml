June T-bonds were trading at 97-2/32, or 31/32 down on the day, immediately before the figures. When the news came out, they made session highs of 97-17/32 before slipping to 97- 12/32.     The payroll rose by 164,000 in March, against analysts' expectations of a 225,000 gain, while the Labour Department revised the February increase down to 236,000 from 337,000. </field></doc></add>
