The offer was made to Kuwait in light of Iran's deployment of Chinese-built missiles to cover the entrance to the Gulf.     Weinberger told reporters prior to a speech at Texas Christian University that he did not think Iran and the United States were moving towards a potential conflict, adding that the Straits of Hormuz at the mouth of the Gulf were still "free water." </field></doc></add>
