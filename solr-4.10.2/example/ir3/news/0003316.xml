Negotiations between the union and employers, which are due to resume early next week, are currently stalemated with the union refusing to accept sweeping changes in working hours and practices in return for a 1.5 pct pay increase.     The FNV spokesman said the action did not yet have official backing, but added that next week matters might be different. </field></doc></add>
