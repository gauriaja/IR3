They said discussions are focusing on conditions for entry into force of the new INRA. The present pact, which expires in October, required that governments accounting for 80 pct of world exports and 80 pct of world imports approved or ratified the pact before it became operational.     Delegates said figures now being floated range between 65 and 80 pct. </field></doc></add>
