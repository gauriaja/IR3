The poll conducted by Newsweek magazine said 53 pct of the respondents gave Reagan a negative performance rating, nearly double his disapproval rating before the Iran/Contra scandal.     The magazine said, however, that Reagan remained personally popular. By better than a three-to-one ratio, a majority of those polled said they liked Reagan on a personal level.     And Newsweek said 52 per cent of those questioned believed the administration"s accomplishments outweighed its failures. </field></doc></add>
