The agency said the rating recognizes risks in Chicago Pacific's highly leveraged balance sheet, uncertainty arising from its consideration of another sizable acquisition and exposure to the European appliance industry.     Moody's said the units Hoover and Rowenta have leading market positions. Debt to capital will be slightly more than 60 pct pro forma, but since Chicago Pacific's plant is modern, capital spending is considered largely discretionary, it said. </field></doc></add>
