PAUL</field><field name="date">March 17</field><field name="content">- St. Jude Medical Inc said its board declared a special dividend of one right for each outstanding share held of the company's common stock, payable to holders of record April Six.     It said each right entitles the holder to buy one-tenth of a share of preferred stock of St. Jude at an exercise price of 100 dlrs.     St. Jude said the rights may be exercised only after 10 days following the acquisition of, or commencement of a tender offer for, at least 20 pct of the company's common stock.     The company added that it has no reason to believe St. Jude Medical is a takeover target. </field></doc></add>
