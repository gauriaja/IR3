Moody's earlier today downgraded six billion dlrs of Merrill debt, citing lagging profitability relative to other brokerage firms and increased competition.     Merrill said it was disappointed by Moody's conclusion. It noted that earnings more than doubled in 1986 to 454 mln dlrs. Equity capital rose 23 pct to 2.9 billion dlrs and return on average equity rose to 17.5 pct from 10.2 pct in 1985. </field></doc></add>
