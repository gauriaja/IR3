He gave no further details of the sale, but added French millers were worried about the unfair competition facing French flour due the lack of end-of-season storage premiums for wheat.     ONIC raised its estimate of 1986/87 flour exports to 1.70 mln tonnes compared 1.65 mln forecast in March and the 1.87 mln exported in 1985/86. </field></doc></add>
