Baker told a House Appropriations Subcommittee the 15 billion dlr recapitalization plan approved by the House panel was sufficient while the 7.5 billion dlr plan in the Senate-passed bill was "inadequate."     He also urged the House to reject loophole-closing provisions in the Senate bill that would restrict banking activities. </field></doc></add>
