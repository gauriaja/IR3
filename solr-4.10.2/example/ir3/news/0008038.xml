He said Reagan last year rejected the idea and he added:     "In my personal view he is not likely to change his thinking on that."     He said Reagan last year opposed the idea because the energy industry was divided on the issue, a tax would require a new bureacracy to administer and the resulting higher energy prices would harm U.S. competitiveness. </field></doc></add>
