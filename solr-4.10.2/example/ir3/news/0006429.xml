Yesterday's edition, received here today, said Vietnam would invest one billion dong, including the costs of relocation, in 272 new economic zones. About one third of that sum would be spent on export crops such as coffee, tea, rubber and pepper in the Central Highlands, it said.     Since 1975, Vietnam has resettled about three million people from cities and crowded river deltas to the zones. </field></doc></add>
