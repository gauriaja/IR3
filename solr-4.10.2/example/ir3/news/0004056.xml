Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain some 650 mln stg while banker's balances below target will take out around 50 mln stg.     Partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions and a fall in note circulation will add some 200 mln stg and 50 mln stg to the system respectively. </field></doc></add>
