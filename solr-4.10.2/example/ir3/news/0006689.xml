He told security analysts Middle South was close to recommending resumption of the common stock dividend when the Mississippi court ordered the rate rollback. Following the order, he noted, the unit cancelled a planned sale of preferred stock. Middle South has petitioned the court for a rehearing or a stay of the order while it is being appealed. </field></doc></add>
