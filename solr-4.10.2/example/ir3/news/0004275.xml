In a summary of its Weather and Crop Bulletin, the agency said scattered showers continued throughout Transvaal, but dry pockets persisted in the northeast and south.     Temperatures average one to four degrees C above normal throughout all grain areas, stressing grain-filling corn in areas receiving lightest rainfall, it said.     The agency said rainfall during February was near to above normal in most areas, but earlier periods of hot, dry weather reduced yield prospects in parts of the northern Transvaal and southern Orange Free State. </field></doc></add>
