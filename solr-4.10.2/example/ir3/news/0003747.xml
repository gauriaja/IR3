The retail price index showed a year-on-year rise of 3.4 pct against three pct in January. An INSEE official said the final figure for February would be released later this month.     After January's rise the government was forced to revise its inflation target for 1987 to 2.5 pct year on year from an initial target of two pct, after 2.1 pct in 1986.     Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said half the January rise was due to higher oil prices and forecast a February slowing. </field></doc></add>
