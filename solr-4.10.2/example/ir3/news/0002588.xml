Both sides gave evidence to the all-party standing committee on Social Affairs today, but committee members said they saw little chance of parliamentary intervention.     The dispute began on January 19 in protest at employers' plans for 800 redundancies from the 4,000-strong workforce, starting with 350 this year. The port and transport union, FNV, is to challenge the redundancies in an Amsterdam court tomorrow. </field></doc></add>
