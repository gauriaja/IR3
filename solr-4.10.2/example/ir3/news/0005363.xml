Sonex said its engine is not equipped with a catalytic converter and does not use exhaust gas recirculation or an emission air pump. It said the company expected to realize a reduced fuel economy, but is working on improving fuel consumption.     The company said after it installs the new fuel system, it will retest the automobile.     In a separate announcement, the company said it received confirmation from the European Patent Office that Sonex successfully defended its BETA European Patent from a competitor. </field></doc></add>
