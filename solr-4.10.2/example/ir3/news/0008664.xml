The company also said it expects capital spending to rise to about 355 mln dlrs in 1987, up from 289 mln dlrs a year ago.     However, senior vice president of finance Daniel Miglio told a meeting of analysts that there was some uncertainty in its earnings outlook because SNET is currently involved in negotiations with state regulators on its rate of return on equity which currently stands at 16.2 pct.     The company also said it expects its SNET Systems business, which is composed of some of its non-regulated businesses, to be profitable by the end of the year. </field></doc></add>
