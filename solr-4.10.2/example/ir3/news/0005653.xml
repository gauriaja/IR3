The case involving the Toyota Shoji Company was highlighted when its 32-year-old Chairman Kazuo Nagano was stabbed to death here in public view in June, 1985.     Television crews which had been waiting outside Nagano's home filmed two men smashing their way into the home and later emerging with a bloodstained bayonet.     The company, established here in 1981, undertook to hold gold on deposit for investors. It grew into a nationwide business operation with 87 branch offices and 7,000 employees at its peak in early 1985.     Toyota Shoji's business group collected an estimated 200 billion yen from about 30,000 clients, many of them pensioners and housewives, before the firm went bankrupt in July, 1985, according to lawyers.     Of them, some 18,000 clients cla27;imed they could get back neither gold or money, suffering an aggregate loss of 150 billion yen, local press reports said.     Police said the five arrested on charge of fraud today included Hiroshi Ishikawa, 47, former Toyota Shoji president, and a sixth former executive was placed on a wanted list.     They were suspected of having collaborated with the late Nagano in swindling about 1.5 billion yen from about 450 people in Osaka and n27;earby Kobe during a six month period just before the firm's bankruptcy, they said.     To27;27;day's arre27;st came a27;27;fter narly two years of joint27; investigation by the public prosecutors and police, who 27;had questioned about 3,000 of27;27; the firm's former employees27;, police sou27;rces 27;27;said. </field></doc></add>
