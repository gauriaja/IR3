The notification came in Japan's answer to a recent GATT questionnaire on unfair trade practices, the spokesman said.     In the five-year plan, which starts this year, South Korea aims to reduce its dependency on Japan as a source of imported goods and to increase imports from the U.S. And Europe.     Japan's move came after several unsuccessful bilateral negotiations on the plan, the spokesman said. "The notification does not represent anything resembling a formal complaint, nor is it intended to pressure South Korea. It is a routine procedure followed by all other GATT member states." </field></doc></add>
