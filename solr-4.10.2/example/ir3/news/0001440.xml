The three -- UBS, Credit Suisse and Swiss Bank Corp -- provided an initial 409 mln franc credit after Argentina signed a contract with Sulzer in 1980. The plant will supply its nuclear power industry.     The extra credit, provided at market rates, covers extra costs incurred due to building delays, a UBS spokesman said. </field></doc></add>
