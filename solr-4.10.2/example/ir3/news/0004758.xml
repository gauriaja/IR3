It said these objectives were based on several assumptions, including a four pct average inflation rate through 1989 and a two pct to three pct GNP real growth.     In 1986, Emhart reported a net loss of 10 mln dlrs or 35 cts a share, after a 90 mln after-tax restructuring charge, which realigned the company's assets.     Emhart has divested itself of many of its units to focus on three primary markets--industrial products, consumer products, and information and electronic systems.     Emhart said industrial products should account for about 62 pct of projected 1987 revenues of 2.3 billion dlrs, while consumer products should account for about 20 pct of those revenues and information and electronic systems about 18 pct. </field></doc></add>
