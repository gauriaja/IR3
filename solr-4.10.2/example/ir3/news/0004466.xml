Operators have already started to take account of the expected change and reported at least one trade in tonnes for Aug/Sept shipment yesterday.     The Federation of Oils Seeds and Fats Associations, FOSFA, in London said it had previously advised traders to adopt the metric system for coconut oil transactions to bring the commodity into line with other vegetable oils. </field></doc></add>
