The changes reflect the restruction of Beneficial which include the sale of subsidiaries Western National Life, American Centennial Insurance Co and Beneficial National Bank USA. Charges taken last year as a result of reserve inadequacies in the property and casualty subsidiary sharply reduced the equity base and increased the financial leverage of the company, Duff and Phelps said. </field></doc></add>
