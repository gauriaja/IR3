Terms were not disclosed. Armtek spokesman John Sievers said S and A is a 50 mln dlr business.     Earlier this week, Armtek announced the sale of its industrial tire and assembly business division to Dyneer Corp of Scotsdale, Ariz.     Cash proceeds from both sales will be used to reduce outstanding debt.      Under a long term supply agreement with Condere, it is anticipated that truck tires produced at the Natchez plant will be supplied to the Armstrong Tire Co, an Armtek operating company, the company said.     The closing is scheduled to be concluded by March 31, it said. </field></doc></add>
