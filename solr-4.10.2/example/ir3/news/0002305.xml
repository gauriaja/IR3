In line with central bank policy he declined to give any details of the amount bought.     The foreign currency purchased was used by the Treasury to repay foreign debt and did not affect the Bank's foreign exchange reserves. They slipped 394 mln francs to 37.33 billion, mostly due to sales of dollars for Special Drawing Rights, the spokesman said. </field></doc></add>
