S and P said if Michigan General's exchange offer for the debentures is not successful, the firm anticipates it will default on the June 1 interest payment and will have to seek protection from creditors under the Federal Bankruptcy Act.     The exchange offer faces numerous obstacles, including the tender of at least 90 pct of the debentures and additional financing from lenders, S and P noted.     The company's implied senior debt rating is CCC-minus. </field></doc></add>
