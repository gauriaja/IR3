The Bank forecast the shortage in the system today at around 1.15 billion stg.     Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain some 732 mln stg and exchequer transactions some 245 mln. In addition, bankers' balances below target and a rise in note circulation will drain a further 135 mln stg and 30 mln stg respectively. </field></doc></add>
