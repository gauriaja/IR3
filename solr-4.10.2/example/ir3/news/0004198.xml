In testimony before a House appropriations subcommittee, Baker said that he had given that message to Brazilian officials earlier this month when they met for talks in Washington.     He said that the so-called Cruzado Plan had worked for a while, but that new efforts by the government are now required.     Baker made it clear that he backed the decision by the Paris Club official creditors to reschedule loans to Brazil, even though the country later froze its payments to commercial bank creditors.     He said that the official loans are being serviced and that this was a result of the rescheduling. </field></doc></add>
