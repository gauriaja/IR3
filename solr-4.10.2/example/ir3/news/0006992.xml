Sales of the predecessor company were 2.68 billion dlrs compared to 2.56 billion dlrs in 1985, including the sales by the operations which are divestiture candidates.     Fruehauf said in connection with the buyout acquisition, the predecessor company incurred about 97 mln dlrs in expenses charged against 1986 operations.     In addition to the direct expenses, Fruehauf said operating results were adversely affected by an unquantifiable amount due to the disruption related to a proxy contest and attempted hostile takeover which started in early 1986.     Fruehauf said its board rescheduled the annual meeting to June 18 from May 7 to allow for completion and distribution of the 1986 results to shareholders. </field></doc></add>
