Share dealers said speculation had arisen in the early pre-bourse market that the Veba announcement could come as early as today. But one banking source, though confirming that most of the details had been worked out, said the chances of an announcement today were about nil. He had no price details.     The 10 mln shares on offer are expected to bring a cash call in Germany for well over two billion marks. The share was around 253 marks today after a 6.50 drop to 252 yesterday. </field></doc></add>
