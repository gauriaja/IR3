Also downgraded were the unit Trinity Industries Leasing Co's 60 mln dlrs of convertible debentures due 2006 to BB-plus from BBB-minus.     S and P said the actions reflected Trinity's weakened earnings due to depressed demand in several key markets, the likelihood that a significant sustained improvement would not occur in the near-term, as well as heightened financial risk from a series of debt-financed acquisitions. </field></doc></add>
