S and P cited expectations of continued profit pressure for this maker of minicomputer products. The rating agency noted that incoming orders remain lackluster and will probably inhibit any significant rebound in profits this year from the recent near breakeven levels.     In the longer term, S and P said an adequate generation of returns on capital would depend on Data General's successful broadening of its customer base. </field></doc></add>
