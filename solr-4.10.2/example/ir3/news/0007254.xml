Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing in official hands will drain some 501 mln stg while a rise in note circulation and bankers' balances below target will take out around 285 mln stg and 45 mln stg respectively.     Partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions will add some 120 mln stg to the system today. </field></doc></add>
