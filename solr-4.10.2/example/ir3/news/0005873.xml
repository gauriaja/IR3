It proposes that applications for intervention be made through a certificate valid for execution three months later. If during the three months the trader found a market elsewhere, he could buy back the certificate on payment of a one pct premium.     Coceral argues that this would restore the original function of intervention as a safety net and would end the present situation in which produce is often sold into intervention as a precaution. </field></doc></add>
