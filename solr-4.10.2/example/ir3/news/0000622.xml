BNL president Nerio Nesi told a news conference that the issue, to be placed on the main international markets and listed in Luxembourg, would be the first equity linked issue by an Italian bank on the Euromarket.     BNL officials said the issue is scheduled for mid-March and additional financial details were not immediately available.     They said the operation would be through the issue of depositary receipts by BNL's London branch. They said the bonds would carry warrants issued by its [Efibanca] subsidiary and convertible into BNL saving shares within five years.     The officials said a banking consortium led by Credit Suisse-First Boston would at the same time arrange for the private placing of an unspecified number of BNL savings shares with foreign institutional investors.     The operation was to further its aim of obtaining a listing on foreign stock exchanges with a view to future capital increases through ordinary share issues, they said. </field></doc></add>
