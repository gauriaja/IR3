Negotiations for a new INRA, to succeed the present one which runs out next October, began nearly two years ago.     Agreement on the new five-year pact, which uses a buffer stock to keep prices stable by selling or buying rubber as rates rise or fall, was reached at a two-week session here under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). </field></doc></add>
