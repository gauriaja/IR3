"We, the developing countries, are going to insist on the application of contingency clauses, to extend deadlines for the payment of capital as well as interest," he said.     He said this could bring about what he called a possible automatic capitalisation of those parts of debt interest that could not be paid and even the elimination of a portion of the debt. </field></doc></add>
