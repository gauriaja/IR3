"I think we got a better deal. It was really an enormous drop, a reduction in rates and that to me is the critical element," he told Reuters.     He was reacting to comments by local economists who said Manila's debt accord was no better than Mexico's, which was a 20-year repayment, including a seven-year grace last year at 13/16 points over London interbank offered rates (Libor).     The Philippines clinched a repayment of 17 years, including a grace period of 7-1/2 years on 10.3 billion dlrs of its total debt of 27.8 billion. </field></doc></add>
