The official, speaking from strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro, said up to 30,000 of Brazil's 40,000 seamen were still on strike.     He said the others had returned to work over the last week, accepting pay offers of 120 pct from four private companies and from the Frota Nacional de Petroleiros (Fronape), part of the state-owned oil company Petrobras.     The association grouping private shipowners, Syndarma, has also offered 120 pct but talks have so far been deadlocked over payment for overtime.     The union official said he believed this issue would be resolved shortly. </field></doc></add>
