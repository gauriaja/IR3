In a statement commenting on the rise last month after a 0.5 pct January decline, Baldrige noted the leading index was rising at an 8.0 pct annual rate in the six months to the end of February.     "Based on past relationships, that gain is consistent with stepped up growth in real GNP during the first half of 1987," Baldrige said. </field></doc></add>
