In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mark IV corrected a statement it made yesterday in another SEC filing in which it listed several agreements reached with Baird, including that Baird would not take any anti-takeover steps without providing at least 24 hours notice.     Mark IV said it was later told by Baird that Baird had given no such assurance. </field></doc></add>
