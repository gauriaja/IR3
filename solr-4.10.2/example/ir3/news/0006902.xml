Laenderbank managing board member Herbert Cordt told Reuters that demand had been strong throughout Europe. The issue, carrying interest of 1/8th of a point over the three-month Vienna Interbank Offered Rate, is the second of its kind. The first was made last October 23.     The issue, made at par, has an initial three-year life and the borrower has the right to make extensions up to 1997. </field></doc></add>
