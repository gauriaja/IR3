The dollar was quoted at around 1.8040 marks shortly after midday in nervous but quiet trading, up from its 1.7975/85 opening.     Spreads against the mark remained around 10 basis points, with some banks quoting only five point spreads. Dealers said spreads would widen and the dollar would move more sharply if the Bundesbank did intervene. </field></doc></add>
