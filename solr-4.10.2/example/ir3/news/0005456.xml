This followed trader talk on the London Metal Exchange, LME, after broker bids were made at increased premiums for Capper Pass brand material.     Traders said some slight production problems seem to exist but are unlikely to have any impact on the market. Lead values on the LME today were unchanged around 299 stg per tonne for three months delivery after thin business in a one stg range. </field></doc></add>
