The company said the expansion will cost about 24 mln dlrs and could be in operation by 1988.     Economies of scale from the expansion should pay back net expansion cost in less than one year, Westmin said.     The Myra Falls complex processed 3,257 tons of ore a day during 1986. Myra Falls 1986 production was 44,000 ounces of gold, 966,266 ounces of silver, 45.5 mln lbs of copper, 96.2 mln lbs of zinc and 777,000 lbs of lead, a company spokesman said.
