No names were given.     Metropolitan police told reporters the four arrested, put under six month pre-trial detention, owed nearly 50.7 mln taka -- the equivalent of about 1.7 mln dlrs -- to Bangladesh Shilpa (Industrial) Bank.     President Hossain Mohammad Ershad has said non-payers are crippling the industrial sector. But the Chamber of Commerce and industry said the crackdown would scare away entrepreneurs. </field></doc></add>
