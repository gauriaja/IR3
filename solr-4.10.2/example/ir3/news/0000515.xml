"It's 99.9 percent--I guarantee you a strike," Gralewicz said in an interview.     The union represents about 2,300 workers on the Great Lakes and Canada's East and West coasts. Contract talks broke off in January and a conciliator has been appointed to try to help settle the dispute. The current contract expires at the end of March.     The seafarers' employers are also asking for a reduction in crew levels, a move which the union said would cost about 400 jobs. </field></doc></add>
