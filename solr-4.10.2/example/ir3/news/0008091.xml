Fed funds were trading at 6-1/8 pct at the time of the "coupon pass," which adds permanent reserves to the banking system.  Economists had predicted an outright purchase of securities this week to counteract a seasonal drain of reserves, but many had expected the Fed to buy bills instead of coupon issues. Bond prices jumped as much as 1/4 point in the initial reaction to the news. </field></doc></add>
