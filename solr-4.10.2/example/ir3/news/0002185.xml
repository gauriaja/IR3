The facility will be used to fund Bank of Ireland's new U.K. Home mortgage subsidiary, BankAmerica Finance Ltd, which will be renamed shortly.     The certificates will be sold through an uncommitted tender panel but the facility will be fully underwritten for five years by a syndicate of banks formed by BZW.     Four banks-- Barclays Bank Plc, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Lloyds Bank Plc and Standard Chartered Bank-- have agreed to underwrite the credit in a pre-syndication agreement and will act as lead managers in syndication, due to begin soon.     Bank of Ireland also said it has appointed BZW as sole dealer on a separate 100 mln stg certificate of deposit program. </field></doc></add>
