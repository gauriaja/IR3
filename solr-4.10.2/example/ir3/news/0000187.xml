The report said the 31 pct devaluation of the Indonesian rupiah, an increase in import duties on copra and increases in the price of Philippines copra have reduced the margin between prices in the two countries.     Indonesia's copra production is forecast at 1.32 mln tonnes in calendar 1987, up from 1.30 mln tonnes in 1986. </field></doc></add>
