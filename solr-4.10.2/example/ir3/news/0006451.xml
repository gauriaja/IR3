Month on month, M1-B fell 5.19 pct from January.     Unadjusted February M1-B was 1,168 billion dlrs against 1,232 billion in January and 788 billion in February 1986.     Money supply grew faster in January because the central bank issued more currency for bonus payments made to workers at the Lunar New Year, which fell on January 29 this year, banking sources said. </field></doc></add>
