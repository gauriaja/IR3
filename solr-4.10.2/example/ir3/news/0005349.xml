The company also said through yesterday, when its tender offer for 3,300,000 Princeville shares was to have expired, it had received over seven mln Princeville shares in the bid, which has been extended until March 23 at 1800 EST.     Qintex said the letter of credit is to insure payment of Princeville's contingent subordinated notes that would be distributed to shareholders of record on the date immediately following completion of the tender offer.     The company said it believes the conditions of the commitment letter will be satisfactory to Princeville.  It said Princeville had previously held talks with a financial institution on obtaining a letter of credit but was unable to reach mutually acceptable terms. </field></doc></add>
