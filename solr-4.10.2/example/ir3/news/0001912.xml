The DOT late today dismissed TWA's application to acquire USAir.     "When the DOT opens for business on Monday morning, we will be refiling a perfected and completed section 408 application," said TWA general counsel Mark Buckstein.     Buckstein said the DOT ruled the application, which was filed Wednesday, was incomplete. He said he did not yet know why the agency objected. </field></doc></add>
