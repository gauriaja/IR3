The plan calls for distribution of one right for each of its outstanding common shares and each right entitles the holder to buy one/one-hundredth of a share of newly authorized Series A Junior Participating cumulative Preferred stock at an exercise price of 55 dlrs, Ameron said.     It said the rights are exercisable if a group acquires 20 pct or more of its common stock or announces a tender offer for 30 pct or more of its shares. </field></doc></add>
