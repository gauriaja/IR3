They said Prime Minister Jacques Chirac planned to urge EC Commission president Jacques Delors to send a team of experts to Washington as soon as possible.     Chirac returned to Paris this morning after three days of talks in New York and Washington in which trade and protectionism featured prominently.     At the centre of the new trade tension is an EC Commission proposal to tax vegetable oils, the sources said. </field></doc></add>
