Little oil was lost in the landslide Friday night because taps on the one mln bpd line were switched off after the accident, they said.     The pipeline, which carries oil for Turkey and other customers from Iraq's Kirkuk field to the Yumurtalik terminal on the Turkish Mediterranean coast, is Iraq's main oil outlet. </field></doc></add>
