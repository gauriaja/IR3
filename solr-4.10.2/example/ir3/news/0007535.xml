Among the main factors affecting liquidity, exchequer transactions will add some 985 mln stg to the system today while a fall in note circulation and bankers' balances above target will add around 360 mln stg and 110 mln stg respectively.     Partly offsetting these inflows, bills for repurchase by the market will drain some 785 mln stg while bills maturing in official hands and the treasury bill take-up will remove about 546 mln stg. </field></doc></add>
