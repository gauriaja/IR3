He told a news conference held during a meeting here of EC agriculture ministers that Britain, West Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Portugal were all against the tax.     Between them, these five countries had more than enough votes in the weighted voting system used in EC ministers' meetings to block a decision, Jopling said. </field></doc></add>
