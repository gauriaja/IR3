Current Soviet interest in chartering ships to carry grain from the U.S. Helped prompt the rumours on world markets. But the diplomats said they had seen no reports in the state press and heard no comments from officials to substantiate them.     The official media was initially slow in reporting the accident but, under Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev's campaign for openness, gradually gave more and more details.     Land around the nuclear plant was contaminated to varying degrees. Some is now being used to grow industrial crops instead of grain. </field></doc></add>
