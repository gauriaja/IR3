Reconstitution is the term used to describe reassembling a treasury security into a book-entry security after it has been separated into its principal and interest components.     In order to reconstitute a treasury security, a deposit-taking institution will have to obtain the appropriate principal component and all unmatured interest components, the Treasury said.     The Federal Reserve Bank of New York will act as the central processing site for reconstituting securities, the Treasury said.     It said reconstitution would enhance the flexibility, liquidity and marketability of treasury securities. </field></doc></add>
