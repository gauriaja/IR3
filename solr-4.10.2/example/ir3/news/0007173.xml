The company said the profit decline will be the result of an increase in reserves for inventory valuation. The increase will be to cover potential write-downs of certain inventories or products used in compact-disc stereo systems.     Burr-Brown said the possible write-down is being precipitated by a shift in market demand toward higher performance products. </field></doc></add>
