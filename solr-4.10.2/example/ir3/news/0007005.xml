With federal funds trading at a steady 6-3/16 pct, most economists expect an indirect injection of temporary reserves via a medium-sized round of customer repurchase agreements.     However, some economists said the Fed may arrange more aggressive system repurchase agreements.     Economists would also not rule out an outright bill pass early this afternoon. Such action had been widely anticipated yesterday but failed to materialize. </field></doc></add>
