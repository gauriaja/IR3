The debentures have an 8-3/4 pct coupon and were priced at 99.784 to yield 120 basis points over the off-the-run 9-1/4 pct Treasury bonds of 2016.     Non-refundable for 10 years, the issue is rated A-1 by Moody's and A by Standard and Poor's. A sinking fund starting in 1998 to retire five pct of the debentures annually can be increased by 150 pct at the company's option, giving them estimated average lives of 20.5 or 14.5 years, Salomon said. </field></doc></add>
