The association groups together the main Yugoslav iron and steel enterprises.     Extraction of iron ore should show an annual growth rate of nine pct and reach seven mln tonnes by 1990 under the program. Iron output is planned to grow at eight pct a year, reaching 4.5 mln tonnes at the end of the decade.     Tanjug said the programme would create conditions for raising exports of finished steel products.     The main Yugoslav steel producers plan to market 5.35 mln tonnes of steel goods this year, or 150,000 tonnes more than last year, with 1.5 mln tonnes going to export. </field></doc></add>
