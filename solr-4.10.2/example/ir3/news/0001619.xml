He said Brazil's decision to stop payments on its debt had captured the attention of the international community but the country should now produce a plan to reform its overheated economy.     "They have everyone's attention but it must be followed by a constructive plan," he said.     Conable made his remarks before a group of commercial bankers at a meeting sponsored by the Export-Import Bank and later informally to reporters. </field></doc></add>
