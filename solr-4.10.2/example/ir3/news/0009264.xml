The market had opened 1/4 to 3/8 point stronger on news of unexpectedly weak U.S. employment data for March, but the advance sparked profit-taking which forced prices down about 1/4 point on the day. Rumors of a major seller were not confirmed but some traders felt limited potential for further Canadian dollar gains might be taking some of the shine off domestic bonds. The benchmark Canada 9-1/2 pct of 2001 ended at 106-1/4 3/8 and the 8-1/2 pct of 2011 at 97-1/4 1/2. </field></doc></add>
