When asked to clarify comments by Rep. Pat Roberts of Kansas that the administration would soon offer Export Enhancement wheat to the Soviet Union Lyng said, "well it won't be today," and then added, "we have no official comment one way or the other."     Lyng would not comment on whether a wheat subsidy offer to the USSR is under more active consideration at the USDA, saying that any remarks by him would be tantamount to an official announcement and could be construed inappropriately. </field></doc></add>
