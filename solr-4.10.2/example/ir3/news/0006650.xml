The agency cited expectations that Mack's profitability will improve over the marginal levels of last year. S and P noted that extensive cost-cutting programs are under way at Mack, including the relocation of truck assembly operations to a new plant in South Carolina from Allentown, Pa.     S and P said that with an improved cost structure, Mack can compete more vigorously for market share without reverting to a loss position. In addition, cash flow from operations should benefit from planned working capital reductions. </field></doc></add>
