The Consumer Affairs and Coinage subcommittee bill would limit credit card interest rates at eight percentage points above the yield on one-year Treasury securities.     If in effect now, the bill would limit credit card rates to 13.8 pct compared to a nation-wide average of 18 pct, the subcommittee said.     The bill now goes to the full House Banking committee for further action. </field></doc></add>
