Approximately 505 mln dlrs of debt is affected.     Moody's said the review was prompted by the recent bid by Donald Trump to acquire control of the company.     The rating agency said its review is focusing on the effects the acquisition is likely to have on Resorts International's leverage and ability to service its debt. Moody's said Resorts already has a highly leveraged capitalization. </field></doc></add>
