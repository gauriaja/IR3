They said the Fed probably will add the reserves indirectly by arranging around two billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements. A direct reserve supply through System repurchase agreements is possible instead.     Federal funds, which averaged 6.33 pct yesterday, opened at 6-3/4 pct and traded between there and 6-3/8 pct. End of quarter demand pressures are pushing up the funds rate. </field></doc></add>
