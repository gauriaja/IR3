Company officials, at a press conference, said the money would be raised through the sale of debentures, adding these securities are expected to be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission following Standard and Poor's Corp's rating of the company's debt next week.     Officials said most of the funds raised will be used to pay down 600 mln dlrs of bridge loans taken out last month when American Hoechst bought Celanese for 2.8 billion dlrs.     The officals said Hoechst Celenese's 1987 capital spending of over 200 mln dlrs will be funded from internally generated cash. They pointed out this is little changed from the combined spending of American Hoechst and Celanese Corp in 1986. </field></doc></add>
