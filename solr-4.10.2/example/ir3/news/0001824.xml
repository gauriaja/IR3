"The negotiations are not going to prosper if (the creditor banks) do not change the counter-proposal put to Argentina, as it is a Swiss cheese full of holes," ruling Radical Party Deputy Raul Baglini said.     Baglini, who was recently observing negotiations with the steering committee for Argentina's creditor banks in New York, spoke to reporters in Mendoza, 600 miles west of Buenos Aires.     Baglini said the counter-proposal did not take into account Argentina's request for a 2.15 billion dlr loan to meet four pct growth targets in 1987. </field></doc></add>
