Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain some 338 mln stg while bankers' balances below target will take out around 25 mln stg.     Partly offsetting these outflows, a fall in note circulation and exchequer transactions will add some 45 mln stg and 25 mln stg to the system respectively. </field></doc></add>
