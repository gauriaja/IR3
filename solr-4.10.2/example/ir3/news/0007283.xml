The central bank stepped into the market when the dollar fell towards 149.00 yen, but a trust bank aggressively sold dollars to hedge currency risks, and the Bank intervened again at 149.00, they said.     The trust bank apparently changed its earlier view that the dollar would rise and started selling relatively large amounts of dollars, pushing the unit down to 148.80 at one point, brokers said.     One dealer estimated that the Bank bought 400 mln to 500 mln dlrs as it tried to keep the U.S. Currency above 149 yen. </field></doc></add>
