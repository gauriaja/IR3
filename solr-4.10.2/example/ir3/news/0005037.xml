The first mortgage bonds were lowered to D/P-7 (low single A) from D/P-4 (low double A), and the preferred stock to D/P-8 (high triple B) from D/P-5 (high single A), it said.     The ratings reflect continuing erosion of a major segment of its sales base as the outlook for the taconite industry continues to be depressed, D/P said. </field></doc></add>
