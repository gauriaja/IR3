The central bank intervened as a medium-sized trading house sold dollars, putting pressure on the U.S. Currency, they said.     The dollar was also supported by a major electrical consumer goods company, which was a speculative dollar buyer at around 145.25 yen, they added.     The dollar opened at 145.33 yen against 145.60/70 in New York and 145.25 at the close here yesterday. </field></doc></add>
