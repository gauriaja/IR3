The ship set off this morning from the Dardanelles port of Canakkale with flags flying and watched by sightseers, the agency said.     Prime Minister Turgut Ozal said last night the ship would not go into international waters unless Greece did the same.     "We are waiting for the first move from them," he told Turkish Radio in London. </field></doc></add>
