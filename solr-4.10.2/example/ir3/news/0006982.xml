(EMP) plans to build its second unit for production of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), a gasoline additive replacing lead, company sources said.     The Coruna-based plant, with an annual capacity of 27,000 tonnes, and a 55,000-tonnes-per-year facility that EMP will start up in Tarragona next year, will make the state refiner Spain's biggest producer of MTBE.     Petroleos del Norte S.A. (Petronor) runs a 45,000 tonne a year plant in Bilbao and Cia Espanola de Petroleos S.A. (Cepsa) plans to put a similar unit onstream next year in Algeciras. </field></doc></add>
