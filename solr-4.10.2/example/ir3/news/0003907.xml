It said Seven Oaks direct management will own the remaining 20 pct.     The company said initial costs connected with the startupo of a new Memphis, Tenn., marketing center for Seven Oaks direct may hurt earnings slightly in the first half of the year ending in April 1988, but Seven Oaks Direct should operate at no worse than breakeven for fiscal 1988 as a whole. </field></doc></add>
