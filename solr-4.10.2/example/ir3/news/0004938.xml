The February surplus compared with a deficit of 1,578 billion lire in the same month for 1986.     For the first two months of 1987, the balance of payments showed a surplus of 302 billion lire against a deficit of 4,622 billion in the same 1986 period.     The Bank of Italy said the cumulative balance for the first two months of 1987 does not match the total calculated on the individual monthly figures because of the provisional nature of certain data. </field></doc></add>
