Asked if the U.S. Federal Reserve Board agreed in Paris last month to intervene to stabilise exchange rates, Miyazawa said yes, the sources said.     Miyazawa was also quoted as saying that he is sceptical about the effectiveness of currency reference ranges even if major nations agree on such an idea as it is extremely difficult to set such ranges. </field></doc></add>
