Moody's said Home Shopping leads the shop-at-home industry and is profitable, but noted that a newly emerging industry is associated with risk. A proposed 300 mln dlr debt offering will increase leverage, though proceeds will be used to redeem high interest cost debt.      It also cited Home's plans to expand its customer base, product line and pending plans to acquire Baltimore Federal Financial FSA as factors that would increase financial risk. </field></doc></add>
