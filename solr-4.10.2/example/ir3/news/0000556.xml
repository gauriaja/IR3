Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain some 525 mln stg while bankers' balnces below target will take out around 175 mln stg.     Partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions and a fall in note circulation will add some 300 mln stg and 40 mln stg to the system respectively. </field></doc></add>
