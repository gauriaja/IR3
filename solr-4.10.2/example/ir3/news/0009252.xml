It said invitations were sent to two Alaskan electric utilities, the city and borough of Anchorage and the state of Alaska.  It did not cite a possible purchase prices.     The requests were limited to Alaskan entities because the purpose of privatization of the administration was to put the local utility into the hands of a local body, the DOE said.     It added that proposals are due back by August three.     The DOE said it then had 120 days to select a proposal that it would recommend to Congress, which then would vote the recommendation up or down.     Proposals to buy the other major part of the Alaska Power Administration, the Eklutna project, was expected to be issued in early June, it said. </field></doc></add>
