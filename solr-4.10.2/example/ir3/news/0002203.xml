The charges on cargo handled by union workers will be reduced to 2.85 dlrs a ton from 5.85 dlrs a ton, effective April one, according to the agreement between the union and shippers. The assessments are used to fund workers' benefits.     "What were doing is lowering the price to get more bulk cargo flowing through here," a spokesman for the New York Shipping Association said. </field></doc></add>
