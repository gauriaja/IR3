The debentures due 1998, were issued in 1984 and were zero coupon notes for the first five years. Beginning 1990, they were to receive semi-annual interest payments at an annual rate of 16 pct.     Morgan said the complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, stems from the recent voluntary liquidation of Metromedia which has intentionally created an event of default on the notes.      The company said the default amount is 574.24 dlrs for each 1,000 dlrs principal amount of debentures. The figure takes into account the deep discount the holders received when they bought the issue.     Morgan Guaranty said there is about 30 mln dlrs principal outstanding. </field></doc></add>
