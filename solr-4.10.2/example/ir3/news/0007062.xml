It said the unit is a catalytic reformer, which converts low-octane components of gasoline into high-octane components for use in Super Unleaded gasoline.     The company said the modernization will allow the unit to regenerate catalysts on a continuous basis without shutdown. Currently, it must be shut twice a year.  The unit produces 46,000 barrels of gasoline components a day.  Construction will start late this year, with completion set for mid-1989.
