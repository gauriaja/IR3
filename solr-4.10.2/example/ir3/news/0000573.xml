A KLM spokesman said KLM already cooperated closely with Air UK, which runs 111 flights a week to Amsterdam's Schipol airport from nine UK cities.    British and Commonwealth Shipping said last week it held preliminary talks about a KLM minority stake in Air U.K. But gave no further details. KLM said it hoped the move would attract more British feeder traffic to Amsterdam Airport. </field></doc></add>
