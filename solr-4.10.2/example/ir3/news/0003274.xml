A union spokesman in Rio de Janeiro said the seamen had accepted a 120 pct pay offer from the companies, Globo and Flumar, which have less than 200 employees each.     The two-week strike comes as Brazil faces a debt crisis and is delaying exports badly needed to earn foreign exchange.     Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto said the government will not force a settlement of the strike, which was ruled illegal last Friday. </field></doc></add>
