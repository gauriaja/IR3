The agency said a decline in sales and profits were little offset from the company's retail business. Also, foreign producers eroded Brown's assets by gaining market share.     Brown's debt ratio increased to 49.8 pct by year-end 1986 as higher inventories, and a four-year stock repurchase program has required additional financing, S and P said.     Restructuring efforts should improve productivity but not in the forseeable future, the agency added. </field></doc></add>
