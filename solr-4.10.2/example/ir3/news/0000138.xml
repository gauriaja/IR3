Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) said yesterday that Lyng had indicated he would consider giving those farmers the same two dlr bonus offered corn farmers who are signing up for the 1987 program this month.     But the aide to Lyng said it was doubtful that the department would offer a retroactive bonus to farmers who enrolled land in the 10-year conservation reserve last year.     "How are you going to stop the tide," he said, referring to demands that would follow from other commodity groups. </field></doc></add>
