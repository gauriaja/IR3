The most significant factor for the lack of a distribution this month is the establishment of additional special cost escrow accounts, the company said, adding, that there may be no cash distribution in other months or during the remainder of the year.     For March, the working interest owner will place 1.9 mln dlrs in special cost escrow accounts. </field></doc></add>
