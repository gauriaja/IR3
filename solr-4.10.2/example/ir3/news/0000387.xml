In a filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Trunkline said, it is reducing its commodity rate -- the portion of the total rate based on the price of gas -- to 2.58 dlrs per mln Btu from 2.69 dlrs per mln Btu.     The company said the lower rate results from a reduction in the average price the pipeline is paying for gas, adding this reflects contract reformation agreemats with producers. </field></doc></add>
