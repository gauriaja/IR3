At a rally in this city, about 100 km northwest of Sao Paulo, about 5,000 bank workers voted to strike on March 24 unless their demand for 100 pct pay rises is met.     Wilson Gomes de Moura, president of the national confederation which groups the bank employees' 152 unions representing 700,000 workers, told Reuters the indefinite stoppage would affect all banks.     The vote came as a stoppage by seamen entered its third week and as 55,000 oil workers threatened action against the state-owned petroleum company Petrobras. </field></doc></add>
