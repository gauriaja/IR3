Frozen pork belly stocks at 34.5 mln lbs on March 1 compared with a revised 34.9 mln lbs on February 1 for a net out movement of 0.5 mln lbs.     The number on hand compared with trade guesses of 33.5 to 36 mln lbs and the year ago figure of 51.2 mln lbs.     Traders said the figure was toward the upper end of expectations and may provide slight downward pressure because of recent sharp gains in futures. </field></doc></add>
