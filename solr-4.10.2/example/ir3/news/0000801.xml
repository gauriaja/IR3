"In my view, debt conversions or swaps into either equity or local debt claims provide a preferable route to 'debt relief' for the debtor nations, particularly if combined with measures to encourage new equity investment and the repatriation of flight capital," he told the House Subcommittee on International Development Institutions.     Mulford criticized what he called large-scale solutions to the debt problems effecting many developing countries, ranging from debt forgiveness to creating new multilateral institutions for lending.     "While such approaches may have some political appeal, they are impractical and ultimately counterproductive," he said.     He said debt conversions, or swaps, are more effective because they eliminate the interest service on converted debt, create new jobs and open up investment opportunities that can help indebted countries overcome their own problems. </field></doc></add>
