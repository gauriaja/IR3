The rating change reflects expectations of lower fixed charge coverages and lower internal funding over the next several years, Duff and Phelps said.     An interim cut in electric rates in Delaware and Maryland to reflect a lower allowed return on equity was made in the second half of 1986. A final decision is expected in April. </field></doc></add>
