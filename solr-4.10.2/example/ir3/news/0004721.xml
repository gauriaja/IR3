AFG has 185 mln dlrs of BB-plus subordinated debt and GenCorp carries 100 mln dlrs of same-rated subordinated debt.     Financing terms of the proposed acquisition are unknown, including AFG's equity contribution to the partnership. S and P said AFG's appetite for substantial acquisitions is aggressive. The tender offer would likely heighten financial risk and increase leverage for GenCorp, S and P said. </field></doc></add>
