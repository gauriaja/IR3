He said that, unlike Saudi Arabia, Kuwait did not impose any conditions on Brazil.     Last month, Petrobras cancelled a 40-mln dlr oil purchase from Saudi Arabia after the Saudis refused to accept credit guarantees from the official Bank of Brazil.     The Saudis eventually lifted the condition and Brazil decided to reconfirm the purchase.     Brazil currently consumes 1.1 mln barrels of oil per day. </field></doc></add>
