S and P cited Coastal's success in reducing debt and preferred stock by 390 mln dlrs last year, despite weak energy prices. As debt is repaid, pretax interest coverage should rise gradually from the current depressed 1.4 times level.     Raised were Coastal's notes, debentures and Eurobonds to BB-minus from B-plus and subordinated debt and preferred to B-plus from B-minus. S and P upgraded the units Wycon Chemical Corp and ANR Finance N.V./B.V.     Wycon Chemical's industrial revenue bonds, guaranteed by the parent, were raised to BB-minus from B-plus.     S and P upgraded ANR Finance's Euronotes to BB-minus from B-plus, ANR Pipeline Co's first mortgage bonds to BB-plus from BB, debentures and Eurobonds to BB-minus from B-plus and preferred to BB from B-plus.     Also, Colorado Interstate Gas Co's first mortgage bonds were raised to BB-plus from BB and debentures to BB-minus from B-plus, while the unit's preferred was affirmed at BB.     A manageable debt maturity schedule for the next few years mitigates concern over Coastal's capital structure, S/P said. </field></doc></add>
