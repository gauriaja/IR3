Terms were not disclosed.     Closing is expected in the second quarter, following approval of definitive agreements.     Products made at the plant represent less than 1/10 of one pct of Du Pont's annual sales, it said. Quilon chrome complexes and Volan bonding agents will be supplied by the plant to Du Pont under contract.     Established in 1866, the plant was acquired by Du Pont in 1928. The plant no longer fits the company's long-term strategy, Du Pont said </field></doc></add>
