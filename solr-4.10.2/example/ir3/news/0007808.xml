Wheat growth was halted by cold weather, and rain early in the week prevented fertilizer application and weed spraying. Fields in the west were short of nitrogen, and moderate insect activity was noted in the southwest region.     Wheat condition was rated 15 pct fair, 84 pct good and one pct excellent.     Row crop activity was very slow amid wet conditions. Topsoil moisture was rated 30 pct adequate and 70 pct surplus, and subsoil moisture was rated 100 pct adequate. Only two days were suitable for fieldwork. </field></doc></add>
