Earlier today MTS said it held talks with Pratt Hotel Corp [PRAT] and Southmark Corp [SM] on forming a venture to acquire Caesars.     MTS also reported that it received a "negligible" number of Caesars World shares in response to its 28 dlr per share tender offer.     Earlier this month Caesars World rejected the Sosnoff takeover bid and said it is considering alternatives that include a restructuring or sale of the company to another party. </field></doc></add>
