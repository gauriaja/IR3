The measure was published today in the Official State Gazette. It takes effect tomorrow and lifts restrictions on rates, now limited to six pct on deposits of up to 180 days.     The government also enacted a decree cutting to one pct from 13 pct the proportion of total assets which banks must lend at favourable rates to industries classified "of public interest."     Some bankers expect the deregulation of rates to result in a 20 pct drop in profits this year.     Secretary of State for the Economy Guillermo de la Dehesa told Reuters in a recent interview the reduction in fixed asset investments would offset losses from the rate liberalisation. </field></doc></add>
