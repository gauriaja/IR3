Prior to this move Innovex owned 79 pct of Lucht, the company said.     Innovex said it bought the shares by exchanging 293,101 shares of unregistered Innovex common stock. Innovex president, Thomas Haley, said the exchange is non-dilutive and will cause a slight increase in Innovex's fully diluted earnings per share during the last half of fiscal 1987.     Lucht will continue to function as a unit of Innovex, Innovex said. </field></doc></add>
