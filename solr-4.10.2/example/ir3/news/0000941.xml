Moody's said this reflected the strengthening of terms in a revised net worth agreement between GEMICO and its immediate parent, General Electric Credit Corp, whose long-term unsecured debt is also a top-flight Aaa.     However, the rating agency said the agreement does not benefit other GEMICO affiliates in California, Florida and North Carolina. </field></doc></add>
