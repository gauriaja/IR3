Inflation for the 12 months ending in February was 23 pct, the spokesman said.     February price rises were mostly in housing, health, education, entertainment and transport.     Wage and price controls have been in force since August 1985. Officials said the controls have helped soften the effect of a recent 10 pct devaluation of the shekel. </field></doc></add>
