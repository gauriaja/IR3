Ryan told analysts, although he declined to forecast earnings specifically.     In 1986, the company reported operating income of 5.51 dlrs a share, up from 4.84 dlrs a share a year earlier. Revenues increased to 1.81 billion dlrs from 1.36 billion dlrs.     Ryan said Combined is testing a direct response long-term care product through its Union Fidelity Life Insurance Co and has plans to offer it through Ryan Insurance Group.     In answer to a question on Combined's possible exposure to AIDS-related health claims, Ryan said it was "minimal" although he conceded that every carrier who provides coverage is vulnerable. </field></doc></add>
