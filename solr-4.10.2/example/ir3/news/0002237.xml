While the combination would strengthen both airlines' market position and enhance revenue generating capability, USAir Group would require substantial debt to finance the 1.6 billion dlr acquisition, S and P said.     USAir's balance sheet and cash flow support of debt, among the strongest in the industry, would be weakened by financing all-cash acquisitions of Piedmont and PSA Inc. USAir's A-rated senior debt is already on S/P watch for possible downgrade. </field></doc></add>
