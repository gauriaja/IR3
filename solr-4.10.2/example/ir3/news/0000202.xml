An 18 member contact group will meet at midday to examine new ideas, and the full council is to convene at 1900gmt, they said.     The extension resulted from a last ditch effort by Colombia to salvage the talks, which by late yesterday looked perilously close to ending without agreement on quotas, delegates said. </field></doc></add>
