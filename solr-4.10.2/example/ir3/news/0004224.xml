"This year should be the fifth solid year in a row for homebuilding activity -- with single-family units stronger than multi-family units," he said in a statement.     Single-family starts rose last month from January levels by 5.6 pct to 1.317 mln units on a seasonally adjusted basis while multi-family unit starts fell 4.1 pct to 534,000 units, the department reported. </field></doc></add>
