The company earlier reported a two mln stg rise in pretax profit to 40 mln in the six months to end-January. The figure was some five mln below forecasts and Lucas shares dropped sharply to 557.5p at 1130 GMT from last night's close of 590p.     It said it would continue with plans for all its activities to be internationally competitive and profitable.     Costs of restructuring, reorganisation, employee training and retraining, particularly in the UK automotive businesses, together with high research and development spending would affect profits in the short term.     But Lucas said it was exploiting growth opportunities in automotive markets, especially in vehicle breaking and engine management systems. Recent acquisitions in North America had strengthened Lucas Aerospace and Lucas Industrial systems. </field></doc></add>
