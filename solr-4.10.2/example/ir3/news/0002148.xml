It said the qualification related to its inability to determine the effects, if any, of the final resolution of a suit filed against it by [Washington Public Power Supply System].  The 1985 suit was dismissed in a 1986 lower court action, but the ultimate outcome of the matter is still uncertain since Washington Public Power has appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals. </field></doc></add>
