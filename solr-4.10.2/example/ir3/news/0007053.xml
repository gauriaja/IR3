They said a special committee of agricultural experts from EC member states had voiced strong objections over the measure during a meeting charged with preparing the ground for the annual EC farm price-fixing which begins next Monday.     They added that only France and Italy had indicated they would support the Commission proposal which would lead to a tax initially of 330 Ecus per tonne during the 1987/88 price round. </field></doc></add>
