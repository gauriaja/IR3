The pre-dawn explosion ripped the wooden elevator open, and a fire that followed continued burning at late morning but had been contained, according to a dispatcher at the Algona Police Department.     No injuries were reported at the Lone Rock Coop facility.     The dispatcher said the elevator was filled with corn, and a nearby drying building holding soybeans was on fire.     The explosion was the second in four days in Iowa following the destruction of an Archer Daniels Midland elevator in Burlington last Friday. </field></doc></add>
