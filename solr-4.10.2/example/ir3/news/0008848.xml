Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills for repurchase by the market will drain some 664 mln stg while bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will take out around 508 mln stg and a rise in note circulation some 45 mln stg.     Partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions and bankers' balances above target will add some 380 mln stg and 35 mln stg to the system respectively. </field></doc></add>
