The department said the proposed change is in response to a petition from Public Voice for Food and Health Policy and would present a more positive image of this grade of beef and help calorie-conscious consumers select leaner cuts of meat.     Under current rules, the "good" grade of meat has less marbling and fat than the "prime" or "choice" grades, it said.     Standards for all of the grades would remain unchanged under the proposal. </field></doc></add>
