Chairman Clive Knobbs said in the annual report the mine was expected to mill a higher tonnage while capital expenditure during 1987 will be around 118.5 mln rand.    The decline in gold production last year was due to a four pct drop in tonnage milled and a seven pct decline in grade. </field></doc></add>
