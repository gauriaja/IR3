He denied a suggestion by a dealer at one Vienna bank that the National Bank had sold marks to support the U.S. Currency.     Senior dealers at Creditanstalt and Girozentrale, Austria's two largest banks, said they would have been aware of any National Bank intervention. Any dollar purchases by the Bank today were for purely day-to-day purposes, they said. </field></doc></add>
