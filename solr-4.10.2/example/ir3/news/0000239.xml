AFRICAN TRADE SANCTIONS</field><field name="place">STOCKHOLM</field><field name="date">March 2</field><field name="content">- Sweden's ruling Social Democratic Party gave full power to the government to decree unilateral trade sanctions against South Africa, Prime Minister Ingvar Calrsson said.     Carlsson told a news conference the party decided the fight against apartheid took priority over Sweden's traditional policy of only adopting sanctions with the backing of the U.N. Security Council.     The government will decide later what form the trade boycott will take and when it will come into force. </field></doc></add>
