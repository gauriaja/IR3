Miguel Alfaro, president of the agricultural league of the sugar cane industry, said the sale follows a recent 50 pct cut in Costa Rica's quota for sugar exports to the U.S.     Alfaro said up to 45,000 tonnes of sugar could be exported to the Soviet Union this year under the deal, which is similar to one the Soviets made recently with the Dominican Republic.     A Soviet ship will load 25,000 tonnes at the Pacific port of Punta Morales Monday, Alfaro said, and a second ship will take an additional 7,107 tonnes two days later.     Alfaro and other industry sources declined to disclose the price at which the sugar was sold. </field></doc></add>
