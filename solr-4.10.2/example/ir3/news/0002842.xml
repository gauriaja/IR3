It estimated the shortage at around 1.55 billion stg, one adverse factor being the unwinding of a sale and repurchase agreement, with the market having to buy back bills worth 542 mln stg from the Bank.     Bills maturing in official hands and the treasury bill take-up would drain 957 mln stg wile exchequer transactions and a note circulation rise would take out 15 mln and 25 mln respectively. Above target bankers' balances would add 10 mln. </field></doc></add>
