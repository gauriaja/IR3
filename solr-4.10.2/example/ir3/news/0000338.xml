They expect it to supply the reserves indirectly by arranging a fairly large round, two billion dlrs or more, of customer repurchase agreements. The Fed may add the reserves directly instead via System repurchases.     Federal funds, which averaged 6.02 pct on Friday, opened at 6-1/8 pct and traded between there and 6-1/16 pct. Funds are under upward pressure from settlement of recently sold two-year notes and from a Treasury tax and loan call on banks. </field></doc></add>
