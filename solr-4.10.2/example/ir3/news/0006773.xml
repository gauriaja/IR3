Cut were Dana's senior debentures, industrial revenue bonds and medium-term notes to A-minus from A, and commercial paper of Dana and its unit Dana Credit Corp to A-2 from A-1.     S and P said Dana's management plans an aggressive stock repuchase which would result in a significantly more leveraged capital structure.
